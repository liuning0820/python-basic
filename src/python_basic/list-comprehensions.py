# List comprehensions
# List comprehensions are concise and easy to read, at least for simple expressions. And they
# are usually faster than the equivalent for loops, sometimes much faster.
# But, in my defense, list comprehensions are harder to debug because you canâ€™t put a print
# statement inside the loop. I suggest that you use them only if the computation is simple
# enough that you are likely to get it right the first time. And for beginners that means never.
